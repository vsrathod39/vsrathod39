### 🚀 Abount Me
---

🤔 I used to wonder how applications & mobile games used to work. When I was in high school, I started researching coding languages such as C and C++ and was also intrigued by the boom of android in the IT industry. In 2014, This was the time when I bought my first laptop with the aim that one day I will also create an application.

📚 With the mindset to learn more about computers and electronics, I decided to complete my graduation(B.tech) in Electronics and Communication and thought I'd do coding simultaneously. I successfully completed my graduation in 2020, but unfortunately was unable to complete any coding course.

💻 Last year(2020), I came across Masai School and I decided that I'm going to quit my job and learn to code and fulfill my dream. I have learned about MERN stack web development technologies, frameworks and data-structure algorithms.

🐱‍💻 Now, I can develop full-fledged operational modern web apps with my tech skills such as MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, npm, Git/GitHub, and SQL.
